**Customer Churn Prediction**

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue a service, enabling businesses to take preventive actions. The dataset was preprocessed through feature encoding, scaling, and handling missing values. Multiple classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks were explored to improve prediction accuracy. The final model provides valuable insights into customer behavior and helps in reducing churn rate, supporting data-driven decision making.
